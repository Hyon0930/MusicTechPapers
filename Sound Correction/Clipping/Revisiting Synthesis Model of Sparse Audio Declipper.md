>Abstract: The state of the art in audio declipping has currently been achieved by SPADE (SParse Audio DEclipper) algorithm by Kiti´c et al. Until now, the synthesis/sparse variant, S-SPADE, has been considered signiﬁcantly slower than its analysis/cosparse counterpart, A-SPADE. It turns out that the opposite is true: by exploiting a recent projection lemma, individual iterations of both algorithms can be made equally computationally expensive, while S-SPADE tends to require considerably fewer iterations to converge. In this paper, the two algorithms are compared across a range of parameters such as the window length, window overlap and redundancy of the transform. The experiments show that although S-SPADE typically converges faster, the average performance in terms of restoration quality is not superior to A-SPADE.
