#2016 [An Efficient Algorithm for Clipping Detection and Declipping Audio](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=18486)
Author: Dukes, Bob
>Abstract: We present an algorithm for end to end declipping, which includes clipping detection and the replacement of clipped samples. To detect regions of clipping, we analyze the signalâ€™s amplitude histogram and the shape of the signal in the time-domain. The sample replacement algorithm uses a two-pass approach: short regions of clipping are replaced in the time-domain and long regions of clipping are replaced in the frequency-domain. The algorithm is robust against different types of clipping and is efficient compared to existing approaches. The algorithm has been implemented in an open source JavaScript client-side web application. Clipping detection is shown to give an f-measure of 0.92 and is robust to the clipping level.
