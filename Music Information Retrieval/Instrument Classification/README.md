>**Abstract**: Knowledge of the instrumentation of a musical signal at any given time could be useful for major audio signal processing problems such as sound source separation and automated music transcription. Knowing which instruments are playing is a first step toward more intelligently designed solutions to these very important and largely unsolved challenges. So, in this paper, we attempt the problem of identifying the instrumentation of a musical signal at any given time using several machine learning techniques (logistic regression, K-NN, SVM). We approached the problem as a series of separate binary classifications (as opposed to a multivariate problem) so that we could mix and match the best algorithm for each instrument to create the best overall classifier.
