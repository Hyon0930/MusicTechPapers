>**Abstract**: The periodic structure of musical events plays a crucial role in the perception of tempo as well as the sensation of note changes and onsets. In this paper, we introduce a novel function that reveals the predominant local periodicity (PLP) in music recordings. Here, our main idea is to estimate for each time position a periodicity kernel that best explains the local periodic nature of previously extracted note onset information and then to accumulate all these kernels to yield a single function. This function, which is also referred to as PLP curve, reveals musically meaningful periodicity information even for non-percussive music with soft and blurred note onsets. Such information is useful not only for stabilizing note onset detection but also for beat tracking and tempo estimation in the case of music with changing tempo.

#  [Automatic Chord Detection Incorporating Beat and Key Detection](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4728534/)
**Author**: Zenz, Veronika; Rauber, Andreas

>**Abstract**: We introduce an algorithm that analyzes audio signals to extract chord-sequence information. The main goal of our approach lies in incorporating music theoretical knowledge without restricting the input data to a narrow range of musical styles. At the basis of our approach lies pitch detection using enhanced autocorrelation, supported by key detection and beat tracking. The Chords themselves are identiﬁed by comparing generated and reference Pitch Class Proﬁles. A smoothing algorithm is applied to the chordsequence which optimizes the number of chord changes and thus takes into consideration the comparatively stable nature of chords. In this paper we present an evaluation performed on a large set of 35 pieces of diverse music showing an average performance of 65% accuracy.

>**Abstract**: This paper addresses the problem of the performance evaluation of algorithms for the automatic detection of note onsets in music signals. Our experiments show that creating a database of reference ﬁles with reliable humanannotated onset times is a complex task, since its subjective part cannot be neglected. This work provides a methodology to construct such a database. With the use of a carefully designed software tool, called SOL (Sound Onset Labellizer), we can obtain a set of reference onset times that are cross-validated amongst different expert listeners. We show that the mean error of annotated times across test subjects is very much signal-dependent. This value can be used, when evaluating automatic labelling, as an indication of the relevant tolerance window. The SOL annotation software is to be released freely for research purposes. Our test library, 17 short sequences containing about 750 onsets, comes from copyright-free music or from the public RWC database. The corresponding validated onset labels are also freely distributed, and are intended to form the starting point for the deﬁnition of a reliable benchmark.
