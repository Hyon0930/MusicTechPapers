#2016 [Variation in Multitrack Mixes: Analysis of Low-level Audio Signal Features](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=18332)
Author: Wilson, Alex; Fazenda, Bruno
>Abstract: To further the development of intelligent music production tools towards generating mixes that would realistically be created by a human mix-engineer, it is important to understand what kind of mixes can be created, and are typically created, by human mix-engineers. This paper presents an analysis of 1501 mixes, over 10 different songs, created by mix-engineers. The primary dimensions of variation in the full dataset of mixes were “amplitude,” “brightness,” “bass,” and “width” as determined by feature-extraction and subsequent principal component analysis. The distribution of representative features approximated a normal distribution and this is then used to obtain general trends and tolerance bounds for these features. The results presented here are useful as parametric guidance for intelligent music production systems.
