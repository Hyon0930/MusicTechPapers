#2009 [Real-Time Chord Recognition for Live Performance](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~markp/2009/StarkPlumbley09-icmc.pdf)
Author: Stark, Adam M
>Abstract: This paper describes work aimed at creating an efﬁcient, real-time, robust and high performance chord recognition system for use on a single instrument in a live performance context. An improved chroma calculation method is combined with a classiﬁcation technique based on masking out expected note positions in the chromagram and minimising the residual energy. We demonstrate that our approach can be used to classify a wide range of chords, in real-time, on a frame by frame basis. We present these analysis techniques as externals for Max/MSP.
