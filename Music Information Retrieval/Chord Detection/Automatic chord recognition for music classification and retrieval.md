>Abstract: As one of the most important mid-level features of music, chord contains rich information of harmonic structure that is useful for music information retrieval. In this paper, we present a chord recognition system based on the N-gram model. The system is time-efficient, and its accuracy is comparable to existing systems. We further propose a new method to construct chord features for music emotion classification and evaluate its performance on commercial song recordings. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of using chord features for music classification and retrieval.
