>**Abstract**: Chord recognition systems depend on robust feature extraction pipelines. While these pipelines are traditionally hand-crafted, recent advances in end-to-end machine learning have begun to inspire researchers to explore data-driven methods for such tasks. In this paper, we present a chord recognition system that uses a fully convolutional deep auditory model for feature extraction. The extracted features are processed by a Conditional Random Field that decodes the ﬁnal chord sequence. Both processing stages are trained automatically and do not require expert knowledge for optimising parameters. We show that the learned auditory system extracts musically interpretable features, and that the proposed chord recognition system achieves results on par or better than state-of-the-art algorithms.

#  [Real-Time Chord Recognition for Live Performance](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~markp/2009/StarkPlumbley09-icmc.pdf)

>**Abstract**: This paper describes work aimed at creating an efﬁcient, real-time, robust and high performance chord recognition system for use on a single instrument in a live performance context. An improved chroma calculation method is combined with a classiﬁcation technique based on masking out expected note positions in the chromagram and minimising the residual energy. We demonstrate that our approach can be used to classify a wide range of chords, in real-time, on a frame by frame basis. We present these analysis techniques as externals for Max/MSP.

#  [Automatic chord recognition for music classification and retrieval](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4607732/)

>**Abstract**: As one of the most important mid-level features of music, chord contains rich information of harmonic structure that is useful for music information retrieval. In this paper, we present a chord recognition system based on the N-gram model. The system is time-efficient, and its accuracy is comparable to existing systems. We further propose a new method to construct chord features for music emotion classification and evaluate its performance on commercial song recordings. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of using chord features for music classification and retrieval.
