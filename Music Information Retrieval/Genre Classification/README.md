>**Abstract**: This study investigates the use of non-linear unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques to compress a music dataset into a low-dimensional representation which can be used in turn for the synthesis of new sounds. We systematically compare (shallow) autoencoders (AEs), deep autoencoders (DAEs), recurrent autoencoders (with Long ShortTerm Memory cells – LSTM-AEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) with principal component analysis (PCA) for representing the high-resolution short-term magnitude spectrum of a large and dense dataset of music notes into a lower-dimensional vector (and then convert it back to a magnitude spectrum used for sound resynthesis). Our experiments were conducted on the publicly available multiinstrument and multi-pitch database NSynth. Interestingly and contrary to the recent literature on image processing, we can show that PCA systematically outperforms shallow AE. Only deep and recurrent architectures (DAEs and LSTM-AEs) lead to a lower reconstruction error. The optimization criterion in VAEs being the sum of the reconstruction error and a regularization term, it naturally leads to a lower reconstruction accuracy than DAEs but we show that VAEs are still able to outperform PCA while providing a low-dimensional latent space with nice “usability” properties. We also provide corresponding objective measures of perceptual audio quality (PEMO-Q scores), which generally correlate well with the reconstruction error.

>**Abstract**: Music classification is a key ingredient for electronic music distribution. Because of the lack of standards in music classification – or the lack of enforcement of existing standards – there is a huge amount of unclassified titles of music in the world. In this paper we propose a method of classification based on musical data mining techniques that uses co-occurrence and correlation analysis for classification. This method allows for the rapid extraction of similarities between musical titles or artists. We investigate the usability of radio playlists and compilation CD databases for our data mining technique, and we compare the generated results with human similarity judgments. Based on a clustering technique, we show that interesting clusters can reveal specific music genres and allow classifying titles of music in a kind of objective manner.
