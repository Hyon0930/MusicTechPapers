>**Abstract**: There is an increasing number of consumers of broadcast audio who suffer from a degree of hearing impairment. One of the meth- ods developed for tackling this issue consists of creating customiz- able object-based audio mixes where users can attenuate parts of the mix using a simple complexity parameter. The method relies on the mixing engineer classifying audio objects in the mix ac- cording to their narrative importance. This paper focuses on automating this process. Individual tracks are classified based on their music, speech, or sound effect content. Then the decisions for assigning narrative importance to each segment of a radio drama mix are modelled using mixture distributions. Finally, the learned decisions and resultant mixes are evaluated using the Short Term Objective Intelligibility, with ref- erence to the narrative importance selections made by the original producer. This approach has applications for providing customiz- able mixes for legacy content, or automatically generated media content where the engineer is not able to intervene.

#  [From my pen to your ears: automatic production of radio plays from unstructured story text](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/documents/2018/smc_2018_018.pdf)

>**Abstract**: A radio play is a form of drama which exists in the acoustic domain and is usually consumed over broadcast radio. In this paper a method is proposed that, given a story in the form of unstructured text, produces a radio play that tells this story. First, information about characters, acting lines, and environments is retrieved from the text. The information extracted serves to generate a production script which can be used either by producers of radio-drama, or subsequently used to automatically generate the radio play as an audio ﬁle. The system is evaluated in two parts: precision, recall, and f1 scores are computed for the information retrieval part while multistimulus listening tests are used for subjective evaluation of the generated audio.
