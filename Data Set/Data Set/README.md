>**Abstract**: Research on perception of music production practices is mainly concerned with the emulation of sound engineering tasks through lab-based experiments and custom software, sometimes with unskilled subjects. This can improve the level of control, but the validity, transferability, and relevance of the results may suffer from this artiﬁcial context. This paper presents a dataset consisting of mixes gathered in a real-life, ecologically valid setting, and perceptual evaluation thereof, which can be used to expand knowledge on the mixing process. With 180 mixes including parameter settings, close to 5000 preference ratings and free-form descriptions, and a diverse range of contributors from ﬁve different countries, the data offers many opportunities for music production analysis, some of which are explored here. In particular, more experienced subjects were found to be more negative and more speciﬁc in their assessments of mixes, and to increasingly agree with each other.

>**Abstract**: We introduce MedleyDB: a dataset of annotated, royaltyfree multitrack recordings. The dataset was primarily developed to support research on melody extraction, addressing important shortcomings of existing collections. For each song we provide melody f0 annotations as well as instrument activations for evaluating automatic instrument recognition. The dataset is also useful for research on tasks that require access to the individual tracks of a song such as source separation and automatic mixing. In this paper we provide a detailed description of MedleyDB, including curation, annotation, and musical content. To gain insight into the new challenges presented by the dataset, we run a set of experiments using a state-of-the-art melody extraction algorithm and discuss the results. The dataset is shown to be considerably more challenging than the current test sets used in the MIREX evaluation campaign, thus opening new research avenues in melody extraction research.

#  [RWC Music Database: Music Genre Database and Musical Instrument Sound Database](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ae8c/a8c76b9f74fb9dafe03a6b62d11998019fc1.pdf)

>**Abstract**: This paper describes the design policy and speciﬁcations of the RWC Music Database, a copyright-cleared music database (DB) compiled speciﬁcally for research purposes. Shared DBs are common in other research ﬁelds and have made signiﬁcant contributions to progress in those ﬁelds. The ﬁeld of music information processing, however, has lacked a common DB of musical pieces or a large-scale DB of musical instrument sounds. We therefore recently constructed the RWC Music Database comprising four original component DBs: Popular Music Database (100 pieces), Royalty-Free Music Database (15 pieces), Classical Music Database (50 pieces), and Jazz Music Database (50 pieces). In this paper we report the construction of two additional component DBs: Music Genre Database (100 pieces) and Musical Instrument Sound Database (50 instruments). It is our hope that our DB will make a signiﬁcant contribution to future advances in the ﬁeld of music information processing.
