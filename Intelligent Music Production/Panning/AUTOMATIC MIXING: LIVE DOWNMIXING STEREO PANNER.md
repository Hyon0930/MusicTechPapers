>Abstract: An automatic stereo panning algorithm intended for live multitrack downmixing has been researched. The algorithm uses spectral analysis to determine the panning position of sources. The method uses filter bank quantitative channel dependence, priority channel architecture and constrained rules to assign panning criteria. The algorithm attempts to minimize spectral masking by allocating similar spectra to different panning spaces. The algorithm has been implemented; results on its convergence, automatic panning space allocation, and left-right inter-channel phase relationship are presented.
