>Abstract: This work presents an algorithm that is able to achieve novel spatialization effects on multitrack audio signals. It relies on a crossadaptive framework that dynamically maps the azimuth positions of each trackâ€™s time-frequency bins with the goal of reducing masking between source signals by dynamically separating them across space. The outputs of this system are compared to traditional panning strategies in subjective evaluation, and it is seen that scores indicate it performs well as a novel effect that can be used in live sound applications and creative sound design or mixing.

>Abstract: An automatic stereo panning algorithm intended for live multitrack downmixing has been researched. The algorithm uses spectral analysis to determine the panning position of sources. The method uses filter bank quantitative channel dependence, priority channel architecture and constrained rules to assign panning criteria. The algorithm attempts to minimize spectral masking by allocating similar spectra to different panning spaces. The algorithm has been implemented; results on its convergence, automatic panning space allocation, and left-right inter-channel phase relationship are presented.
