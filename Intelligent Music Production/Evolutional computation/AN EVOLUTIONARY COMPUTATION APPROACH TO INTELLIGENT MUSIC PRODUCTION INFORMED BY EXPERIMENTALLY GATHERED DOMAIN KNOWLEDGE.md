#2016 [AN EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION APPROACH TO INTELLIGENT MUSIC PRODUCTION INFORMED BY EXPERIMENTALLY GATHERED DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE](https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/44278/1/Wilson.pdf)
Author: Wilson, Alex; Fazenda, Bruno
>Abstract: A novel methodology for intelligent music production has been developed using evolutionary computation. Mixes are generated by exploration of a “mix-space”, which consists of a series of inter-channel volume ratios, allowing efﬁcient generation of random mixes. An interactive genetic algorithm was used, allowing the user to rate mixes and guide the system towards their ideal mix. Currently, ﬁtness evaluation is subjective but can be aided by speciﬁc domain knowledge obtained from a large-scale study of real mixes.
