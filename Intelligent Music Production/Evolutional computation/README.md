#  [Interactive evolutionary computation: fusion of the capabilities of EC optimization and human evaluation](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/949485/)
**Author**: Takagi, H.

**Year**: 2001
>**Abstract**: In this paper, we survey the research on interactive evolutionary computation (IEC). The IEC is an EC that optimizes systems based on subjective human evaluation. The deﬁnition and features of the IEC are ﬁrst described and then followed by an overview of the IEC research. The overview primarily consists of application research and interface research. In this survey, the IEC application ﬁelds include graphic arts and animation, 3-D CG lighting, music, editorial design, industrial design, facial image generation, speech processing and synthesis, hearing aid ﬁtting, virtual reality, media database retrieval, data mining, image processing, control and robotics, food industry, geophysics, education, entertainment, social system, and so on. Also in this survey, the interface research to reduce human fatigue includes improving ﬁtness input interfaces and displays based on ﬁtness prediction, accelerating EC convergence especially in early EC generations, examining combinations of interactive and normal EC, and investigating active user intervention. Finally, we discuss the IEC from the point of the future research direction of computational intelligence. In order to show the status quo IEC research, this paper primarily features a survey of about 250 IEC research papers rather than a carefully selected representation of a few papers.

#  [AN EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION APPROACH TO INTELLIGENT MUSIC PRODUCTION INFORMED BY EXPERIMENTALLY GATHERED DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE](https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/44278/1/Wilson.pdf)
**Author**: Wilson, Alex; Fazenda, Bruno

**Year**: 2016
>**Abstract**: A novel methodology for intelligent music production has been developed using evolutionary computation. Mixes are generated by exploration of a “mix-space”, which consists of a series of inter-channel volume ratios, allowing efﬁcient generation of random mixes. An interactive genetic algorithm was used, allowing the user to rate mixes and guide the system towards their ideal mix. Currently, ﬁtness evaluation is subjective but can be aided by speciﬁc domain knowledge obtained from a large-scale study of real mixes.
