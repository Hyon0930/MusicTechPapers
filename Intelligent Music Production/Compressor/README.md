>**Abstract**: Dynamic range compression is a nonlinear, time dependent audio effect. As such, preferred parameter settings are difficult to achieve even when there is advance knowledge of the input signal and the desired perceptual characteristics of the output. We introduce an automated approach to dynamic range compression where the parameters are configured automatically based on real-time, side-chain feature extraction from the input signal. Parameters are all dynamically varied depending on extracted features, leaving only the threshold as a user controlled parameter to set the preferred amount of compression. We analyze a series of automation techniques, including comparison of methods based on different signal characteristics. Subjective evaluation was performed with amateur and professional sound engineers, which established preference for dynamic range compressor parameters when applied to musical signals, and allowed us to compare performance of our various approaches against manual parameter settings.

#  [A Feature Learning Siamese Model for Intelligent Control of the Dynamic Range Compressor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01022)
**Author**: Sheng, Di; Fazekas, Gyorgy

>**Abstract**: In this paper, a siamese DNN model is proposed to learn the characteristics of the audio dynamic range compressor (DRC). This facilitates an intelligent control system that uses audio examples to conﬁgure the DRC, a widely used nonlinear audio signal conditioning technique in the areas of music production, speech communication and broadcasting. Several alternative siamese DNN architectures are proposed to learn feature embeddings that can characterise subtle effects due to dynamic range compression. These models are compared with each other as well as handcrafted features proposed in previous work. The evaluation of the relations between the hyperparameters of DNN and DRC parameters are also provided. The best model is able to produce a universal feature embedding that is capable of predicting multiple DRC parameters simultaneously, which is a signiﬁcant improvement from our previous research. The feature embedding shows better performance than handcrafted audio features when predicting DRC parameters for both monoinstrument audio loops and polyphonic music pieces.
