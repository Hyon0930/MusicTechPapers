#2011 [ANALYSIS OF ACOUSTIC FEATURES FOR AUTOMATED MULTI-TRACK MIXING](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2011/paper/000027.pdf)
Author: Scott, Jeffrey; Kim, Youngmoo E
>Abstract: The capability of the average person to generate digital music content has rapidly expanded over the past several decades. While the mechanics of creating a multi-track recording are relatively straightforward, using the available tools to create professional quality work requires substantial training and experience. We address one of the most fundamental processes to creating a ﬁnished product, namely determining the relative gain levels of each track to produce a ﬁnal, mixed song. By modeling the time-varying mixing coefﬁcients with a linear dynamical system, we train models that predict a weight vector for a given instrument using features extracted from the audio content of all of the tracks.

#2017 [Analysis and prediction of the audio feature space when mixing raw recordings into individual stems](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=19245)
Author: Ramírez, Marco A Martínez; Reiss, Joshua D
>Abstract: Processing individual stems from raw recordings is one of the ﬁrst steps of multitrack audio mixing. In this work, we explore which set of low-level audio features are sufﬁcient to design a prediction model for this transformation. We extract a large set of audio features from bass, guitar, vocal and keys raw recordings and stems. We show that a procedure based on random forests classiﬁers can lead us to reduce signiﬁcantly the number of features and we use the selected audio features to train various multi-output regression models. Thus, we investigate stem processing as a content-based transformation, where the inherent content of raw recordings leads us to predict the change of feature values that occurred within the transformation.
