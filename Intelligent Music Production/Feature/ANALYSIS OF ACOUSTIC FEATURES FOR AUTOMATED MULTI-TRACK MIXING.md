#2011 [ANALYSIS OF ACOUSTIC FEATURES FOR AUTOMATED MULTI-TRACK MIXING](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2011/paper/000027.pdf)

>Abstract: The capability of the average person to generate digital music content has rapidly expanded over the past several decades. While the mechanics of creating a multi-track recording are relatively straightforward, using the available tools to create professional quality work requires substantial training and experience. We address one of the most fundamental processes to creating a ﬁnished product, namely determining the relative gain levels of each track to produce a ﬁnal, mixed song. By modeling the time-varying mixing coefﬁcients with a linear dynamical system, we train models that predict a weight vector for a given instrument using features extracted from the audio content of all of the tracks.
