#2017 [Analysis and prediction of the audio feature space when mixing raw recordings into individual stems](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=19245)
Author: Ramírez, Marco A Martínez; Reiss, Joshua D
>Abstract: Processing individual stems from raw recordings is one of the ﬁrst steps of multitrack audio mixing. In this work, we explore which set of low-level audio features are sufﬁcient to design a prediction model for this transformation. We extract a large set of audio features from bass, guitar, vocal and keys raw recordings and stems. We show that a procedure based on random forests classiﬁers can lead us to reduce signiﬁcantly the number of features and we use the selected audio features to train various multi-output regression models. Thus, we investigate stem processing as a content-based transformation, where the inherent content of raw recordings leads us to predict the change of feature values that occurred within the transformation.
