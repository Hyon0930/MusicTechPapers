#2013 [Implementation of an intelligent equalization tool using Yule-Walker for music mixing and mastering](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=16792)
Author: Ma, Zheng; Reiss, Joshua D; Black, Dawn A A
>Abstract: A new approach for automatically equalizing an audio signal towards a target frequency spectrum is presented. The algorithm is based on the Yule-Walker method and designs recursive IIR digital filters using Least-Squares fitting to any desired frequency response. The target equalization curve is obtained from the spectral distribution analysis of a large dataset of popular commercial recordings. A real-time C++ VST plug-in and an off-line Matlab implementation have been created. Straightforward objective evaluation is provided, where the output frequency spectra are compared against the target equalization curve and the ones produced by an alternative equalization method.
