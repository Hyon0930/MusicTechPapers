#2013 [Modeling the Harmonic Exciter](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=16939)
Author: Shekar, Priyanka; Smith, Julius
>Abstract: A harmonic exciter is an audio eﬀects signal processor applied to enhance the brightness and clarity of a sound, particularly used for vocals. This is achieved by inducing a measured amount of high-frequency distortion. In this paper, an exciter is digitally modeled and implemented as a standalone application (or plugin) using the FAUST (Functional AUdio STream) programming language for real-time audio. The model is based on the Aural Exciter by Aphex Ltd., an analog hardware unit. Technical speciﬁcations of the Aural Exciter are drawn from the original 1979 patent. The digital model performs as expected, recreating a “vintage” style audio eﬀect.
