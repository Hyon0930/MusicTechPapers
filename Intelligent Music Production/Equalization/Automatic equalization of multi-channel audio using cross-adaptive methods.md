#2009 [Automatic equalization of multi-channel audio using cross-adaptive methods](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=15026)
Author: Perez, Enrique; Reiss, Joshua
>Abstract: A method for automatically equalizing a multi-track mixture has been implemented. The method aims to achieve equal average perceptual loudness on all frequencies amongst all multi-track channels. The method uses accumulative spectral decomposition techniques together with cross-adaptive audio effects to achieve equalization. The method has applications in live and recorded audio mixing where the audio engineer would like to reduce set-up time, or as a tool for inexperienced users wishing to perform audio mixing. Results are reported which show how the frequency content of each channel is modified, and which demonstrate the ability of the automatic equalization method to achieve a well-balanced and equalized final mix.
