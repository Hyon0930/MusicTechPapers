#2009 [Automatic Target Mixing using Least-Squares Optimization of Gains and Equalization Settings](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/documents/2009/BarchiesiReiss-AutomaticTargetMixing.pdf)
Author: Barchiesi, Daniele; Reiss, Josh
>Abstract: The proposed automatic target mixing algorithm determines the gains and the equalization settings for the mixing of a multi-track recording using a least-squares optimization. These parameters are estimated using a single channel target mix, that is a signal which contains the same audio tracks as the multi-track recording, but that has been previously mixed using some unknown settings.
