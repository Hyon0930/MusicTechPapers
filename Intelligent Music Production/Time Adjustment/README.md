#2008 [Determination and correction of individual channel time offsets for signals involved in an audio mixture](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=14782)
Author: Gonzalez, Enrique Perez; Reiss, Joshua
>Abstract: A method for reducing comb-filtering effects due to delay time differences between audio signals in a sound mixer has been implemented. The method uses a multi-channel cross-adaptive effect topology to automatically determine the minimal delay and polarity contributions required to optimize the sound mixture. The system uses real time, time domain transfer function measurements to determine and correct the individual channel offset for every signal involved in the audio mixture. The method has applications in live and recorded audio mixing where recording a single sound source with more than one signal path is required, for example when recording a piano with multiple microphones. Results are reported which determine the effectiveness of the proposed method.
