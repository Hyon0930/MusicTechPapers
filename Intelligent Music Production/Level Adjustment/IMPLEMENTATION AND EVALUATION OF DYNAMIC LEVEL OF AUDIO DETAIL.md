>Abstract: Sound synthesis involves creating a desired sound using software or algorithms and analysing the digital signal processing involved in the creation of the sound, rather than recording it. However, synthesis techniques are often too computationally complex for use in many scenarios. This project aims to implement and assess sound synthesis models with dynamic Level of Audio Detail (LOAD). The manipulations consist of modifying existing models to achieve a more or less complex implementation while still retaining the perceptual characteristics of the sound. The models implemented consist of sine waves, noise sources and filters that reproduce the desired sound, which could then be enhanced or reduced to provide dynamic LOAD. These different levels were then analysed in the time-frequency domain, and computational time and floating point operations were assessed as a function of the LOAD.
