#2012 [Multi-track mixing using a model of loudness and partial loudness](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=16436)
Author: Ward, Dominic; Reiss, Joshua D; Athwal, Cham
>Abstract: A method for generating a mix of multi-track recordings using an auditory model has been developed. The proposed method is based on the concept that a balanced mix is one in which the loudness of all instruments are equal. A sophisticated psychoacoustic loudness model is used to measure the loudness of each track both in quiet and when mixed with any combination of the remaining tracks. Such measures are used to control the track gains in a time-varying manner. Finally we demonstrate how model predictions of partial loudness can be used to counteract energetic masking for any track, allowing the user to achieve better channel intelligibility in complex music mixtures.
