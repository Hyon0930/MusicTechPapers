#2009 [Automatic gain and fader control for live mixing](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5346498/)
Author: Perez-Gonzalez, Enrique; Reiss, Joshua
>Abstract: A cross-adaptive mixing device has been developed for the purpose of optimizing the gain levels of a live audio mixture. The method aims to achieve optimal mixing levels by optimizing the ratios between the loudness of each individual input channel and the overall loudness contained in a stereo mix. In order to evaluate the amount of loudness of each channel in real-time, accumulative statistical measurements were performed. The system uses a cross-adaptive algorithm to map the loudness indicators to the channel gain values. The system has applications in automatic mixing of live music, live mixing of game audio, and studio recording post-production.
