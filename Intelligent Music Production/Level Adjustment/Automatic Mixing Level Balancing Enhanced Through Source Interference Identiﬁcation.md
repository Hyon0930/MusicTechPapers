#2019 [Automatic Mixing Level Balancing Enhanced Through Source Interference Identiﬁcation](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=20355)
Author: Moffat, David; Sandler, Mark B
>Abstract: It has been well established that equal loudness normalisation can produce a perceptually appropriate level balance in an automated mix. Previous work assumes that each captured track represents an individual sound source. In the context of a live drum recording this assumption is incorrect. This paper will demonstrate approach to identify the source interference and adjust the source gains accordingly, to ensure that tracks are all set to equal perceptual loudness. The impact of this interference on the selected gain parameters and resultant mixture is highlighted.
