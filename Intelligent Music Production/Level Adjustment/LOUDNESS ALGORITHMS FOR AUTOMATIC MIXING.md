>Abstract: Accurate loudness measurement is imperative for intelligent music mixing systems, where one of the most fundamental tasks is to automate the fader balance. The goal of this short paper is to highlight state-of-the-art loudness algorithms to the automatic mixing community, and give insight into their differences when applied to multi-track audio.
