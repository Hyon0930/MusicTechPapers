#2008 [An automatic maximum gain normalization technique with applications to audio mixing.](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=14541)
Author: Gonzalez, Enrique Perez; Reiss, Joshua
>Abstract: A method for real-time magnitude gain normalization of a changing linear system has been developed and tested with a parametric filter design. The method is useful in situations where the maximum gain before feedback is needed. The method automatically calculates the appropriate gain that should be applied in order to maintain maximum unitary gain. The method uses an impulse measurement of a mathematical model of the system to be normalized. This is particularly useful for mixing engineers, who have to continually revise their gain structure in order to maximize gain before feedback. The system is also useful in many other situations where solving the analytical solution from the mathematical model is not possible.
