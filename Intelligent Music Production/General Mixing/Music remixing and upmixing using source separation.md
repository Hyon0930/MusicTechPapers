>Abstract: Current research on audio source separation provides tools to estimate the signals contributed by different instruments in polyphonic music mixtures. Such tools can be already incorporated in music production and post-production workï¬‚ows. In this paper, we describe recent experiments where audio source separation is applied to remixing and upmixing existing mono and stereo music content.
