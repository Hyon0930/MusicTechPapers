#2017 [Towards an Automated Multitrack Mixing Tool using Answer Set Programming](http://smc2017.aalto.fi/media/materials/proceedings/SMC17_p422.pdf)
Author: Everardo, Flavio
>Abstract: The use of Answer Set Programming (ASP) inside musical domains has been demonstrated specially in composition, but so far it hasn’t overtaken engineering areas in studio-music (post) production such as multitrack mixing for stereo imaging. This article aims to demonstrate the use of this declarative approach to achieve a well-balanced mix. A knowledge base is compiled with rules and constraints extracted from the literature about what professional music producers and audio engineers suggest creating a good mix. More specially, this work can deliver either a mixed audio ﬁle (mixdown) as well as a mixing plan in (human-readable) text format, to serve as a starting point for producers and audio engineers to apply this methodology into their productions. Finally this article presents a decibel (dB) and a panning scale to explain how the mixes are generated.
