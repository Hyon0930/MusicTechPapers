#2018 [Towards a Semantic Web Representation and Application of Audio Mixing Rules](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/59960)
Author: Moffat, David; Thalmann, Florian; Sandler, Mark B
>Abstract: Existing literature has discussed the use of rule-based systems for intelligent mixing. These rules can either be explicitly deÔ¨Åned by experts, learned from existing datasets, or a mixture of both. For such mixing rules to be transferable between different systems and shared online, we propose a representation using the Rule Interchange Format (RIF) commonly used on the Semantic Web. Systems with differing capabilities can use OWL reasoning on those mixing rule sets to determine subsets which they can handle appropriately. We demonstrate this by means of an example web-based tool which uses a logical constraint solver to apply the rules in real time to sets of audio tracks annotated with features.
