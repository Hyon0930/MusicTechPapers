>Abstract: Although digital music production technology has become more accessible over the years, the tools are complex and often difﬁcult to navigate, resulting in a large learning curve for new users. This paper approaches the task of automated multi-track mixing from the perspective of applying common practices based on the instrument types present in a mixture. We apply basic principles to each track automatically, varying the parameters of gain, stereo panning, and coarse equalization. Assuming all instruments are known, a small listening evaluation is completed on the mixed tracks to validate the assumptions of the mixing model. This work represents an exploratory analysis into the efﬁcacy of a hierarchical approach to multi-track mixing using instrument class as a guide to processing techniques.
