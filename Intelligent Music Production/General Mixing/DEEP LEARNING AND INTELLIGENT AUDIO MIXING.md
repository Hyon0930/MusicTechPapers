>Abstract: Mixing multitrack audio is a crucial part of music production. With recent advances in machine learning techniques such as deep learning, it is of great importance to conduct research on the applications of these methods in the ﬁeld of automatic mixing. In this paper, we present a survey of intelligent audio mixing systems and their recent incorporation of deep neural networks. We propose to the community a research trajectory in the ﬁeld of deep learning applied to intelligent music production systems. We conclude with a proof of concept based on stem audio mixing as a contentbased transformation using a deep autoencoder.
