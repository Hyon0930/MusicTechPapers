>Abstract: Adaptive Digital Audio Effects are sound transformations controlled by features extracted from the sound itself. Artificial reverberation is used by sound engineers in the mixing process for a variety of technical and artistic reasons, including to give the perception that it was captured in a closed space. We propose a design of an adaptive digital audio effect for artificial reverberation that allows it to learn from the user in a supervised way. We perform feature selection and dimensionality reduction on features extracted from our training data set. Then a user provides examples of reverberation parameters for the training data. Finally, we train a set of classifiers and compare them using 10-fold cross validation to compare classification success ratios and mean squared errors. Tracks from the Open Multitrack Testbed are used in order to train and test our models.
