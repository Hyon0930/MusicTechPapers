>Abstract: Recent research related to artificial reverberation is reviewed. The focus is on research published during the past few years after the writing of an overview article on the same topic by the same authors. Advances in delay networks, convolution-based techniques, physical room models, and virtual analog reverberation models are described. Many new developments are related to the feedback delay network, which is still the most popular parametric reverberation method. Additionally, three specific methods are discussed in detail: velvet-noise reverberation methods, scattering delay networks, and a modal architecture for artificial reverberation. It becomes evident that research on artificial reverberation and related topics continues to be as active as ever.
