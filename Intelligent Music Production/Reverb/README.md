>Abstract: Recent research related to artificial reverberation is reviewed. The focus is on research published during the past few years after the writing of an overview article on the same topic by the same authors. Advances in delay networks, convolution-based techniques, physical room models, and virtual analog reverberation models are described. Many new developments are related to the feedback delay network, which is still the most popular parametric reverberation method. Additionally, three specific methods are discussed in detail: velvet-noise reverberation methods, scattering delay networks, and a modal architecture for artificial reverberation. It becomes evident that research on artificial reverberation and related topics continues to be as active as ever.

>Abstract: Adaptive Digital Audio Effects are sound transformations controlled by features extracted from the sound itself. Artificial reverberation is used by sound engineers in the mixing process for a variety of technical and artistic reasons, including to give the perception that it was captured in a closed space. We propose a design of an adaptive digital audio effect for artificial reverberation that allows it to learn from the user in a supervised way. We perform feature selection and dimensionality reduction on features extracted from our training data set. Then a user provides examples of reverberation parameters for the training data. Finally, we train a set of classifiers and compare them using 10-fold cross validation to compare classification success ratios and mean squared errors. Tracks from the Open Multitrack Testbed are used in order to train and test our models.

#  [Intelligent Multitrack Reverberation Based on Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=18766)

>Abstract: We propose a machine learning approach based on hinge-loss Markov random ﬁelds to solve the problem of applying reverb automatically to a multitrack session. With the objective of obtaining perceptually meaningful results, a set of Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) rules has been deﬁned based on best practices recommended by experts. These rules have been weighted according to the level of conﬁdence associated with the mentioned practices based on existent evidence. The resulting model has been used to extract parameters for a series of reverb units applied over the different tracks to obtain a reverberated mix of the session.
