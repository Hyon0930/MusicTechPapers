>Abstract: Reﬂecting on a decade of Automatic Mixing systems for multitrack music processing, this paper positions the topic in the wider ﬁeld of Intelligent Music Production, and seeks to motivate the existing and continued work in this area. Tendencies such as the introduction of machine learning and the increasing complexity of automated systems become apparent from examining a short history of relevant work, and several categories of applications are identiﬁed. Based on this systematic review, we highlight some promising directions for future research for the next ten years of Automatic Mixing.
