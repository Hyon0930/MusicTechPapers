#2011 [Intelligent systems for mixing multichannel audio](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6004988/)
Author: Reiss, Joshua D.
>Abstract: Multichannel signal processing techniques are usually concerned with extracting information about sources from several received signals. In this paper, we describe an emerging field of multichannel audio signal processing where the inter-channel relationships are exploited in order to manipulate the multichannel content. Applications to realtime, automatic audio production are described and the necessary technologies and the architecture of such systems are presented. The current state of the art is reviewed, and directions of future research are also discussed.
