>Abstract: Multichannel signal processing techniques are usually concerned with extracting information about sources from several received signals. In this paper, we describe an emerging field of multichannel audio signal processing where the inter-channel relationships are exploited in order to manipulate the multichannel content. Applications to realtime, automatic audio production are described and the necessary technologies and the architecture of such systems are presented. The current state of the art is reviewed, and directions of future research are also discussed.

>Abstract: The main focus of this article is to explore and investigate the fundamental constraints that should be at the basis of algorithm development in intelligent audio production systems. Through mix analysis and grounded theory strategies, a best-practices framework on the craft of mixing is sought out. Findings, while not to be taken as dogmatic, give a clear indication of preferred implementation strategies, and show what still needs to be done to fully understand the technical choices that audio mixing has incorporated throughout its history.

>Abstract: Reﬂecting on a decade of Automatic Mixing systems for multitrack music processing, this paper positions the topic in the wider ﬁeld of Intelligent Music Production, and seeks to motivate the existing and continued work in this area. Tendencies such as the introduction of machine learning and the increasing complexity of automated systems become apparent from examining a short history of relevant work, and several categories of applications are identiﬁed. Based on this systematic review, we highlight some promising directions for future research for the next ten years of Automatic Mixing.
