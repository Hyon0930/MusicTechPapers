>Abstract: We propose a convolutional neural network as an alternative to recurrent neural networks for separating out individual speakers in a sound mixture. Our results achieve state-of-the-art results with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. We also characterize the robustness of both models to generalize to three different testing conditions including a novel dataset. We create a new dataset RealTalkLibri which evaluates how well source separation models generalize to real world mixtures. Our results indicate the acoustics of the environment have signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the performance of all neural network models, with the convolutional model showing superior ability to generalize to new environments.
