#2014 [Audio Source Separation Using a Deep Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7193)
Author: Jang, Giljin; Kim, Han-Gyu; Oh, Yung-Hwan
>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised audio source separation using a deep autoencoder. The characteristics of unknown source signals mixed in the mixed input is automatically by properly conﬁgured autoencoders implemented by a network with many layers, and separated by clustering the coefﬁcient vectors in the code layer. By investigating the weight vectors to the ﬁnal target, representation layer, the primitive components of the audio signals in the frequency domain are observed. By clustering the activation coefﬁcients in the code layer, the previously unknown source signals are segregated. The original source sounds are then separated and reconstructed by using code vectors which belong to different clusters. The restored sounds are not perfect but yield promising results for the possibility in the success of many practical applications.

#2001 [Algorithms for Non-negative Matrix Factorization](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1861-algorithms-for-non-negative-matrix-factorization.pdf)
Author: Lee, Daniel D; Seung, H Sebastian
>Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has previously been shown to be a useful decomposition for multivariate data. Two different multiplicative algorithms for NMF are analyzed. They differ only slightly in the multiplicative factor used in the update rules. One algorithm can be shown to minimize the conventional least squares error while the other minimizes the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence. The monotonic convergence of both algorithms can be proven using an auxiliary function analogous to that used for proving convergence of the ExpectationMaximization algorithm. The algorithms can also be interpreted as diagonally rescaled gradient descent, where the rescaling factor is optimally chosen to ensure convergence.

#2019 [A review of blind source separation methods: two converging routes to ILRMA originating from ICA and NMF](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2048770319000052/type/journal_article)
Author: Sawada, Hiroshi; Ono, Nobutaka; Kameoka, Hirokazu; Kitamura, Daichi; Saruwatari, Hiroshi
>Abstract: This paper describes several important methods for the blind source separation of audio signals in an integrated manner. Two historically developed routes are featured. One started from independent component analysis and evolved to independent vector analysis (IVA) by extending the notion of independence from a scalar to a vector. In the other route, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been extended to multichannel NMF (MNMF). As a convergence point of these two routes, independent low-rank matrix analysis has been proposed, which integrates IVA and MNMF in a clever way. All the objective functions in these methods are efficiently optimized by majorization-minimization algorithms with appropriately designed auxiliary functions. Experimental results for a simple two-source two-microphone case are given to illustrate the characteristics of these five methods.

#2016 [Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Test Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00016)
Author: Sell, Connor; Kepner, Jeremy
>Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a problem with many applications, ranging from facial recognition to document clustering. However, due to the variety of algorithms that solve NMF, the randomness involved in these algorithms, and the somewhat subjective nature of the problem, there is no clear “correct answer” to any particular NMF problem, and as a result, it can be hard to test new algorithms. This paper suggests some test cases for NMF algorithms derived from matrices with enumerable exact non-negative factorizations and perturbations of these matrices. Three algorithms using widely divergent approaches to NMF all give similar solutions over these test cases, suggesting that these test cases could be used as test cases for implementations of these existing NMF algorithms as well as potentially new NMF algorithms. This paper also describes how the proposed test cases could be used in practice.
