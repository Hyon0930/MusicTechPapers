#2010 [Melody Extraction from Polyphonic Music Signals using Pitch Contour Characteristics](http://www.mtg.upf.edu/system/files/publications/SalamonGomezMelodyTASLP2012.pdf)
Author: Salamon, Justin; Gomez, Emilia
>Abstract: We present a novel system for the automatic extraction of the main melody from polyphonic music recordings. Our approach is based on the creation and characterisation of pitch contours, time continuous sequences of pitch candidates grouped using auditory streaming cues. We deÔ¨Åne a set of contour characteristics and show that by studying their distributions we can devise rules to distinguish between melodic and non-melodic contours. This leads to the development of new voicing detection, octave error minimisation and melody selection techniques.
