>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a low-latency monaural source separation framework using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We use a CNN to estimate time-frequency soft masks which are applied for source separation. We evaluate the performance of the neural network on a database comprising of musical mixtures of three instruments: voice, drums, bass as well as other instruments which vary from song to song. The proposed architecture is compared to a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), achieving on-par results and a signiﬁcant improvement in processing time. The algorithm was submitted to source separation evaluation campaigns to test eﬃciency, and achieved competitive results.
